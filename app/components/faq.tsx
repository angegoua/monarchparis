          <AccordionContent>
            We begin with a deep-dive session to understand your vision and
            requirements. Within 48 hours, we&apos;ll present you with proposed
            functionality and user flows. We&apos;ll refine these together,

            design direction before we start building. Throughout the process,
            we maintain constant communication via a dedicated Slack channel,

            Our Zero to one starts at 8,000 â‚¬, which covers most standard
            projects. For apps requiring complex features or integrations,
            we&apos;ll provide a custom quote after our initial consultation. We
            believe in full transparency - any additional costs will be
            discussed and agreed upon before we begin work.

            What kind of post-launch support do you provide?
          </AccordionTrigger>
          <AccordionContent>
            We don&apos;t disappear after launch. You&apos;ll receive a
            complimentary 14-day support window, including one iteration cycle
            at no extra cost. While most of our clients find this sufficient
            (thanks to our thorough pre-launch approval process), we&apos;re
            here if you need us. Beyond this, we offer flexible ongoing support
            packages tailored to your needs.

            Alternatively, we can transfer all assets to your accounts for
            direct control. We&apos;e committed to setting you up for success,
